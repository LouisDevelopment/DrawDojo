            Draw Dojo is currently the only service we provide. It provides a platform for anyone to be a creator, an artist and an inspiration to others. 
            Centering on Digital Art, we offer a platform for both creation and uploading of art, providing a platform to anyone and everyone.
        </p>
        <p class="half">
            The platform allows the user to create an account, where they can both upload their own content, and interact with the content of others. 
            But what makes our platform especially unique is the ability to work together and 'mash-up' your art with another creator. Allowing for endless 
            creativity and collaboration between users.

        <p class="half">
            Where other platforms have images as an afterthought, we wanted them to be front and center, with our focus fully on creating something beautiful.
        </p>

        <p class="half">
            With a focus on customisation and personalisation, we wanted to you to allow you to continue to show off who you are with your profile. Giving you the chance to
            pick some posts that best represent you to showcase on your profile.

            Theres also an activity feed, so your followers can keep up with what you've been working on and see who you've been collaborating with! Our focus with this
            project is to let several people put their best features together to create something better than the sum of its parts.
